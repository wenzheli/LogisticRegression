LogisticRegression
==================

Logistic Regression for Java. 

Include those features. 
- Binary classification (we assume response variable is 0,1) 
- Stochastic Gradient Ascent.  (online learning for optimizing maximum likelihood)
- Sparse Feature Vector  (For high dimensional sparse data set, we can represent the feature vector as hashmap, to speed up the learning. 

For derivation, please take a look at the LogisticRegression.pdf
